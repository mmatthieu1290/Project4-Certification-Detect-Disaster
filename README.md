## Description of the files.

**Version_finale_projet1_Matthieu_Marechal.ipynb:** code

**train.csv:** labeled database which contains 7613 tweets. The column "target" is equal to 1 if the tweet is relative to a disaster, else 0. The column "text" contains the tweet, "keyword" contains one or two words related to the tweet (less than 1% of missing values) and "location" contains two many missing values.

**test.csv:** unlabeled database with same features that train.csv.

**sample_submission.csv:** prediction on test.csv.
